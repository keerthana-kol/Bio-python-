Protein: hypothetical protein SPAB_05093
Predicted Function: Phosphoenolpyruvate–protein phosphotransferase (PTS Enzyme I)
----------------
BACKGROUND : 
The phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a major carbohydrate transport system in bacteria. 
PTS Enzyme I catalyzes the first step of the pathway by transferring a phosphate group 
from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to downstream PTS components, enabling sugar uptake 
and metabolism.

FUNCTION PREDICTION :
Based on BLAST analysis using Biopython, the query sequence shows very high similarity 
to annotated PTS Enzyme I and multiphosphoryl transfer proteins from multiple Salmonella 
strains. Although different names are used in databases, all annotations correspond 
to the same functional enzyme in the PTS pathway.
